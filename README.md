Implementation of the Hierarchical and Interpretable Skill Acquisition in Multi-task Reinforcement Learning by Tianmin Shu, Caiming Xiong, and Richard Socher 

### Milestones:

**1.** Set up the environment
- [ ] Define the training environment
- [ ] Define the testing environment
- [ ] Implement blocks/agent random placement
- [ ] Generate tasks

**2.** Build RL models

- [ ] Implement hierarchical model
  - [ ] "Flat" part
  - [ ] Augmented policy
  - [ ] Switch policy
  - [ ] Instruction policy
  - [ ] Use of base policy
  - [ ] A2C optimization
  - [ ] Stochastic Temporal Grammar
  
**3.** Train the agent
- [ ] Flat policy
  - [ ] Task #1 - Find x
